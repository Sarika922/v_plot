1. The vplot is stored in /home/bec51319.iitr/workplace/v_plot/v_plot_final
2. The vplot is made using matplotlib and hence it can be run using python.
3. To run the code and get the image of vplot as output, zless mapped.bed.gz was piped into the python code and the image was saved as v_plot_output.png
4. CODE: zless mapped.bed.gz | python v_plot20.png
5. The image from the paramganga account was transferred to local machine via command scp bec51319.iitr@paramganga.iitr.ac.in/home/bec51319.iitr/workplace/v_plot/v_plot_final/v_plot_output.png C:HP\Users\HP\Downloads\
6. The image is saved in the local machine which can be visualised.
